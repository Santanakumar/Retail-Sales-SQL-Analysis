## INTRODUCTION
### Background
Retail companies generate massive volumes of transactional data daily.
However, raw sales data often contains:
- Missing values
- Invalid transactions
- Inconsistent formatting
- No direct revenue metrices

To extract meaningful insights, analysis must first clean and structure the dataset before performing business analysis.

### Motivation
Retail businesses generate large volumes of transactional data every day. However, raw sales datasets are often incomplete, inconsistent, and not directly usable for analysis.

The motivation behind the project was to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow by cleaning retail transaction data, engineering meaningful revenue-based features, and generating business insights such as sales trends, top-performing products, and high-value customers using SQL.
